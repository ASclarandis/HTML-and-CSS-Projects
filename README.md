# HTML-and-CSS-Projects
This repository contains all of the course work assigned to me for the HTML and CSS course through The Tech Academy.

**The Basic HTML and CSS and Basic HTML and JavaScript** folders contain extremely basic HTML structures and elements, such as changing font color and size. 

**Cat's Meow Cafe** is a one page websites containing pictures, backgrounds, interactive nav bar, photo/text overlays, and a contact form.

**Creating a CSS Menu** is a blank webpage with an interactive nav bar.

**One-Page Website** is similar to Cat's Meow Cafe, but with less CSS styling.

**Projects** contains a webpage with animations and a favicon.

**Bootstrap4 Project** utilized Bootstraps to create a  colorful webpage.
